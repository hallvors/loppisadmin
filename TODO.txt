TODO:

* configurable constants for property names (our very nice G Docs form generates odd names..)
* add "Sendt til henter"-state to clarify distinction between "sent" and "accepted"
* workflow - what happens after a message is sent? Unselect? Auto-status-updates?
 - add auto-set status to "Sendt til henter" and "Kontaktet" on SMS sending, notify admin with flash popup and unselect items

* make visibility a property of data items, leave updating list to Svelte-generated code. Refactor somewhat to remove code we don't need after this change.

* focus handling, esp with menus and modals.
 - Implement proper "return focus to previously selected" on closing menus/modals
